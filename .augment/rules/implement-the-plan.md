# Implement the Current Plan
- Deeply review an thuroughly understand the current plan.
- Review all previous work that was done.
- Figure out what the next phase or batch is to continue working on.
- Search the codebase to understand how we are going to efficiently and accurately perform the next round of work.
- Do not create extra **.md docs ever unless requested by the user.
- Always create a set of testing procedures at the completion of each phase and/or batch in the docs\tests\** folder. Naming conventions must match the current phase and/or batch for clarity.

# IMPORTANT
- Re-use UI components where possible, and to understand the components that are available you can review app\composables\useComponentDocs.ts
- If no UI component exists, let the user know and create a Linear issue/ticket using the Linear MCP server to create the component in the future.
