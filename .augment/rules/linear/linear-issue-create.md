# Linear Issue Create
- I want you to use the Linear MCP to search for the project related to this application and create an issue for each this implementation.

- Inside of the issue, create a sub-issue for each Phase.

- For the batches of tasks under each Phase, make sure create a markdown check list within the sub-issue for all batches of tasks related to the Phase.

- You shall create the Phases/Sub-Issues in sequential order.

- Only proceed if you fully understand, otherwise ask clarifying questions.

----

After completing a Phase:

- Create a comment with a detailed summary in the active working issue/sub-issue.

- Git commit the progress.

- Ask the user if it's ok to proceed.
