    "text": "Craig and his team did an amazing job resuscitating our 2-year old driveway that had started to erode.  Seams were crumbling and holes were appearing in multiple sections.  Craig's work to smooth the surface, refill and repair then seal with multiple coats of a beautiful color-matched sealant was nothing short of masterful.  And the work he did to transform the front porch from a bare concrete slap to a gorgeous entry of tumbled stone was pure artistry.  Thank you so much Craig!  See you when you come back to transform the back patio!"

    "text": "Our front walkway was long overdue for a makeover, and Craig from Concrete Enhancements absolutely brought it back to life. What used to be a dull slab of concrete is now a beautiful entryway that looks like something straight out of a design magazine. He created a hand-cut flagstone pattern with a mix of warm tans, beiges, and sandstone hues, all framed with real brick borders that match the front of our house perfectly.\n\nIt’s hard to describe how much character and warmth it adds — every time we walk up to the door, it feels like a brand-new home. The surface is smooth, sturdy, and has that natural stone look that impresses everyone who visits.\n\nCraig doesn’t just pour concrete — he creates art. You can tell he takes pride in his work and genuinely wants you to be amazed by the end result. Our neighbors have already asked who did it, and I’m more than happy to point them toward Concrete Enhancements. They don’t just do good work; they create lasting impressions."
